<h2>RESTful API with FLASK</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A RESTful API is the application program interface that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE to interact with server resources.</li>
  <li>With HTTP requests and RESTful API we can interact with server data resources (in this case I use the in-memory python list as a database)</li>
  <li>Using RESTful API in Flask, I can define the way of interacting with server via HTTP requests returning the response back to a client (browser)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing HTTP methods and RESTful API</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Project has been written along with automated testing.</li>
  <li>With testing we can check the Client-API-Server performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>RESTful API with FLASK</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.</li>
  <li>With HTTP requests we can interact via RESTful API with server resources (in this case I use the in-memory python list as a database)</li>
  <li>Using RESTful API with Flask I can define the way of interacting with server via HTTP requests returning the response back to a client(browser)</li>
</ul>
